To simplify the display of the different conditions a set of predefined templates are defined so it is sufficient to send the I\-Ds and relative strings to create the needed visualisation.

This mechanism will also reduce the code size of the program.\par
 Every template has a symbolic I\-D and is built by a simple structure where every string to be shown has its own row and columns. Then a single recursive method can be used to generate the visualisation The templates are though as static objects leaving the space, where needed, for the variable data; in this case the template defines only the position on the display but does not define the content.\par
 Tas the template is an abstraction of the visualisation the strings are not defined statically\-:\par
{\bfseries  the template is filled at runtime}\par
 Every template is an array of a set of basic {\bfseries fields} defining the parameters where a certain value should be shown.
